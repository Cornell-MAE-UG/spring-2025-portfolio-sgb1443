## About Me
<img src="profile.jpg" alt="Sarah Grace Brown" style="width: 300px; height: auto;">
I'm a Mechanical Engineer passionate about creating robotic systems that push the limits of what people and machines can do. I aim to work on robotics and autonomous systems that expand what's currently possible, combining mechanical design, actuation, controls, and autonomy to bring complex ideas to life.

I have extensive experience designing underwater robotic systems through my work with CUAUV, Cornell's Autonomous Underwater Vehicle project team. My most recent work includes developing a patent-pending fiber optic end effector for composite manufacturing at Lockheed Martin. I'm currently part of Cornell's Autonomous Systems Lab, where I'm designing the mechanical systems, controls, and computer vision for an underwater autonomous soft robotic fish.
