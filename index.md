## About Me

  <img src="profile.jpg" alt="." style="width: 300px; height: auto;">

My name is **Sarah Grace Brown**, and I‚Äôm a mechanical engineering student at Cornell University with a passion for robotics, 
hands-on design, and interdisciplinary innovation. I bring experience in advanced manufacturing, autonomous vehicle development, 
and mechatronics through roles at **Tiffany & Co.**, **Lockheed Martin**, and the **Cornell 
Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (CUAUV)** team, where I currently serve as Mechanical Subteam Lead.

I thrive at the intersection of creativity and precision‚Äîleading projects from concept to deployment, whether that‚Äôs designing 
competition-ready AUV frames, building tactile soft robots in research labs, or implementing new production methods in high-end 
jewelry production. I strive to contribute to robotics applications that humans can‚Äôt‚Äîor shouldn‚Äôt‚Äîdo themselves, 
including those in extreme environments or with high risk.

My technical strengths include SolidWorks, Rhino, FEA, Python, C++, MATLAB, and embedded systems design using 
Arduino and Artemis platforms.

Beyond the lab, I manage organizational finances as Tri Delta's Director of Member Finances and serve as Treasurer for 
Impact dance troupe, blending leadership and community with my engineering journey. I have also completed the Dyson Business Minor.
