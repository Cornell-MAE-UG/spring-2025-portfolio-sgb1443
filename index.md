## About Me

![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/profile.jpg" | relative_url }}){: .profile-image}

My name is **Sarah Grace Brown**, and I’m a mechanical engineering student at Cornell University with a passion for robotics, 
hands-on design, and interdisciplinary innovation. I bring experience in advanced manufacturing, autonomous vehicle development, 
and mechatronics through roles at **Tiffany & Co.**, **Lockheed Martin**, and the **Cornell 
Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (CUAUV)** team, where I currently serve as Mechanical Subteam Lead.

I thrive at the intersection of creativity and precision—leading projects from concept to deployment, whether that’s designing 
competition-ready AUV frames, building tactile soft robots in research labs, or implementing new production methods in high-end 
jewelry production. I strive to contribute to robotics applications that humans can’t—or shouldn’t—do themselves, 
including those in extreme environments or with high risk.

My technical strengths include SolidWorks, Rhino, FEA, Python, C++, MATLAB, and embedded systems design using 
Arduino and Artemis platforms.

Beyond the lab, I manage organizational finances as Tri Delta's Director of Member Finances and serve as Treasurer for 
Impact dance troupe, blending leadership and community with my engineering journey. I have also completed the Dyson Business Minor.
