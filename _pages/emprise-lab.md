# EmPRise Lab
## Cornell University - Robotic Tactile Sensing

**Lab:** EmPRise Lab (Embodied, Perception, Robotics, and Intelligence Science Lab)  
**Institution:** Cornell University  
**Duration:** October 2025 - Present  
**Focus:** Distributed Tactile Sensing for Robotic Manipulation

## Project Overview

Developing modular tactile sensing systems for robotic arms to enable advanced whole-arm manipulation capabilities. This research focuses on integrating distributed sensor arrays into robotic arm links to provide comprehensive touch feedback for complex manipulation tasks.

## Technical Work

### Modular Casing Design

**Objective:** Design protective casings for robotic arm links that integrate tactile sensing arrays

**Design Approach:**
- Created modular, repeatable casing designs adaptable to different arm segments
- Integrated force-sensing resistor (FSR) arrays throughout the structure
- Designed compact housing for ESP32 microcontroller boards
- Implemented organized cable routing system for power and data connections
- Optimized for durability while maintaining flexibility for manipulation tasks

**Skills:** Mechanical Design, CAD, Modular Systems

### Sensor Integration

**Hardware Components:**
- **Force-Sensing Resistor Arrays:** Distributed tactile sensors providing spatial touch data
- **ESP32 Microcontrollers:** Edge processing for real-time sensor data acquisition and preprocessing
- **Cable Management:** Organized routing for power, data, and sensor connections

**System Design:** Created a "skin" for robotic arms that provides distributed tactile feedback, enabling the robot to sense contact forces and locations across its entire arm surface.

**Skills:** Sensor Arrays, ESP32, Electronics Integration

## Research Application

### Whole-Arm Manipulation

This tactile sensing system enables advanced robotic manipulation research where the robot can:
- Detect contact forces across the entire arm surface, not just the end effector
- Perform manipulation tasks using the entire arm (whole-arm manipulation)
- Adaptively respond to contact forces during manipulation
- Enable safer human-robot interaction through distributed touch sensing
- Support research in compliant manipulation and force control

## Technical Challenges

### Design Considerations
- **Compactness:** Fitting electronics and sensors within limited space while maintaining arm mobility
- **Durability:** Protecting sensitive electronics during manipulation tasks
