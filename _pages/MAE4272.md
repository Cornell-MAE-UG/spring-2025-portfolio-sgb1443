# Small-Scale Wind Turbine Blade Design
**MAE 4272: Fluids and Heat Transfer Laboratory** | Team: Matt Bulger, Sarah Grace Brown, Marco Conte, Joshua McCrae | Fall 2024

## Project Overview

As part of Cornell's MAE 4272 course, our team designed, analyzed, and tested a small-scale wind turbine blade optimized for maximum torque generation in low Reynolds number conditions (Re ≈ 9,300–21,000). Operating in the Big Blue wind tunnel under a Weibull wind distribution (mean speed 4.6 m/s), the three-bladed rotor faced strict constraints: 6-inch maximum radius, 2-inch maximum chord, 2000 rpm speed limit, and fabrication via SLA printing in Accura 25 material. The design prioritized reliable startup torque over peak aerodynamic efficiency, targeting operation at tip-speed ratio λ = 3 and 900 rpm.

## Design Process

We began with statistical analysis of the Weibull wind distribution to establish our operating Reynolds number range, then selected the S1223 airfoil for its exceptional lift characteristics at low Re (CL_max = 1.8-2.0, nearly double that of conventional NACA airfoils). Using blade element momentum theory, we calculated optimal twist distribution ranging from 60° at the root to 14° at the tip to maintain a 3° angle of attack across the span. The chord tapered linearly from 2.0 inches at the root to 0.4 inches at the tip to reduce bending loads while maintaining adequate solidity inboard.

MATLAB structural analysis confirmed a critical failure wind speed of 67.73 m/s—more than 10× above our operating range—validating the design's structural adequacy. ANSYS Fluent CFD simulations predicted 11.03 W power output, though CAD-to-CFD workflow challenges required manual airfoil file editing and multi-segment lofting to resolve trailing edge closure issues.

## Testing and Results

Wind tunnel testing employed progressive loading from 2-10 volts on the magnetic brake to prevent premature stall, allowing full torque characterization at constant wind speeds (3, 5, and 7 m/s). Testing revealed our blade performed significantly better than predicted: maximum power output consistently occurred around 1300 rpm rather than the designed 900 rpm. At 7 m/s with maximum brake loading, the blade operated at only 1300 rpm—well below the 2000 rpm safety limit—and required progressively higher brake torque to stall as wind speed increased, indicating we never reached maximum performance within available test conditions.

This suggests the blade's aerodynamic capability exceeded both our low-Re design predictions and the tunnel's operational envelope, demonstrating successful torque optimization while maintaining all safety margins.

## My Contribution

I led the aerodynamic design phase, conducting Reynolds number analysis, performing airfoil selection studies comparing S1223 against NACA 4412, and implementing blade element momentum theory calculations to determine optimal twist and pitch distributions. I developed MATLAB scripts for performance prediction and structural validation, calculating torque outputs across the wind speed range and verifying that bending stresses remained within material limits. Additionally, I coordinated the team's experimental protocol development.
