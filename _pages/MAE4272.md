# Small-Scale Wind Turbine Blade Design
**MAE 4272: Fluids and Heat Transfer Laboratory** | Team: Matt Bulger, Sarah Grace Brown, Marco Conte, Joshua McCrae | Fall 2024

## Project Overview

As part of Cornell's MAE 4272 course, our team designed, analyzed, and tested a small-scale wind turbine blade optimized for maximum torque generation in low Reynolds number conditions (Re ≈ 9,300–21,000). Operating in the Big Blue wind tunnel under a Weibull wind distribution (k=5, c=5 m/s, mean speed 4.6 m/s), the three-bladed rotor faced strict constraints: 6-inch maximum radius, 2-inch maximum chord, 2000 rpm speed limit, and fabrication via SLA printing in Accura 25 material. The design prioritized reliable startup torque over peak aerodynamic efficiency, targeting operation at tip-speed ratio λ = 3 and 900 rpm.

## Design Philosophy and Approach

### Operating Point Selection

The design began with statistical analysis of the Weibull wind distribution to establish our operating regime. Using the probability density function p(U) = (k/c)(U/c)^(k-1)exp(-(U/c)^k) with k=5 and c=5 m/s, we determined a mean wind speed of 4.59 m/s with 5th and 95th percentiles at 2.76 and 6.23 m/s. For the maximum allowable chord of 2 inches (0.0508 m) and air kinematic viscosity ν = 1.5×10⁻⁵ m²/s, the Reynolds number spans 9,349–21,088 with Re_mean = 15,548, confirming operation in a low-Re regime where laminar effects dominate.

### Tip-Speed Ratio and Torque Optimization

Tip-speed ratio fundamentally determines the torque-efficiency balance. At high λ (> 6), blades move faster than the wind, creating small angles of attack and aligned lift vectors that produce high efficiency but low torque. At low λ (≈ 2-3), slower blade motion generates larger angles where lift contributes more tangentially to rotational moment. We selected λ = 3 to maintain an effective angle of attack at 6-10° where low-Re airfoils achieve maximum lift-to-drag ratio while rotating the lift vector substantially from the axial direction for strong tangential force. This torque-focused approach accepts lower aerodynamic efficiency in exchange for reliable startup and stable operation in variable wind conditions. From λ = 3, U = 4.59 m/s, and R = 0.152 m, the target speed Ω = λU/R = 94.25 rad/s ≈ 900 rpm provided margin below the 2000 rpm safety limit.

## Airfoil Selection: S1223 Justification

Conventional NACA airfoils perform poorly in low Reynolds number regimes because the boundary layer remains laminar over most of the airfoil surface and cannot withstand adverse pressure gradients, leading to premature separation, reduced lift generation, and increased pressure drag. This led us to investigate specialized low-Re airfoils.

We evaluated NACA 4412 and S1223 using XFOIL and published wind tunnel data at Re ≈ 15,000, ultimately selecting S1223 for four critical reasons:

**1. Exceptional Lift Generation:** The S1223 achieves CL_max = 1.8-2.0 at Re = 10,000-20,000, nearly double that of NACA 4412. The S1223 maintains CL > 1.5 from 6-12° angle of attack while NACA 4412 peaks at CL ≈ 1.0. This exceptional lift generation translates directly to higher torque per unit span when projected tangentially through the inflow angle.

**2. Gentle Stall Characteristics:** The S1223 exhibits gentle stall behavior with gradual separation and maintained lift over a broad angle range, ensuring consistent torque during startup and operation outside the design range.

**3. Superior Aerodynamic Efficiency:** The S1223 achieves peak lift-to-drag ratios of 50-60 near α = 3-5°, aligning with blade element theory predictions at λ = 3. The S1223 maintains superior L/D over NACA 4412 from 4-10°, precisely our anticipated operating range.

**4. Practical Manufacturing Advantages:** The S1223's 12% thickness supplies structural depth at the root while 8-9% camber maintains high-lift characteristics outboard. The pressure distribution helps prevent flow separation at low Reynolds numbers, critical for maintaining performance in our operating regime.

## Blade Geometry Design

### Twist Distribution

Using blade element momentum theory, we calculated the local inflow angle φ(r) = arctan(U/(Ωr)) assuming negligible induction. To maintain the optimal angle of attack α_opt ≈ 3° from S1223 data, we set geometric pitch as β(r) = φ(r) - α_opt. This produced the following twist distribution:

- **Root (r/R = 0.25):** β ≈ 55-60°
- **r/R = 0.40:** β ≈ 36°
- **Mid-span (r/R = 0.50):** β ≈ 30°
- **r/R = 0.70:** β ≈ 21°
- **Near tip (r/R = 0.90):** β ≈ 16°

The extreme root twist angles (r < 0.22R) were blended into the cylindrical hub attachment at the thickest portion of the airfoil, providing maximum cross-sectional area between the airfoil and mounting geometry. This improved printability and structural robustness with minimal loss of aerodynamic performance.

### Chord Taper

The chord distribution employed linear taper from 2.0 inches at the root to 0.4 inches at the tip. This taper maintains higher solidity inboard where tangential velocities are lower, reduces root bending moment by decreasing loads at outboard stations, and provides a structurally sound planform. The resulting aspect ratio of approximately 4.0 (R/c_mean = 6/1.5) balanced aerodynamic efficiency, structural stiffness, and manufacturing feasibility.

## Structural Validation

MATLAB scripts computed bending moments along the blade span from distributed aerodynamic loads predicted by blade element theory. Each blade cross-section was modeled as a solid rectangle with thickness t = 0.12c, yielding section modulus Z = bc²/6 where b is the chord.

At the design point (U = 4.59 m/s), the maximum root bending moment was calculated as 0.022 N·m, below both the magnetic brake limit (0.035 N·m) and the material capacity. To determine structural failure wind speed, we applied load scaling analysis: since aerodynamic forces scale approximately with U² at constant λ, the critical wind speed is U_crit = U√(σ_allow/σ_current). Using Accura 25's tensile strength of 38 MPa, the analysis predicted structural failure at 67.73 m/s—more than 10× above the operating range.

## CFD Analysis

ANSYS Fluent CFD simulations were performed using a 120° wedge geometry with periodic boundary conditions to model blade rotation. We used polyhedral volume mesh elements with hexagonal surface mesh on the blade to capture aerodynamic details while maintaining reasonable computational time. The k-omega turbulence model was selected for low Reynolds number flows.

The simulation predicted 11.03 W power output at design conditions. Pressure contours revealed expected high-pressure regions on the blade front face where flow stagnates, and corresponding low-pressure regions on the back face. This pressure differential creates the moment that drives blade rotation.

**CAD-to-CFD Challenges:** Initial geometry export issues arose from the finite trailing edge point creating an unclosed STEP file. This required manual editing of the airfoil .dat file to bridge the trailing edge with an arc. The loft could not be solved as a continuous feature, requiring individual lofts between adjacent sections that were merged together, creating minor sharp edges between sections visible in Figure 3. However, overall geometry largely matched our design and was deemed acceptable for CFD analysis.

## Experimental Testing and Results

### Testing Protocol

Wind tunnel testing employed progressive loading from 2-10 volts on the magnetic brake to prevent premature stall, allowing full torque characterization at constant wind speeds (3, 5, and 7 m/s). Initial attempts with abrupt high-torque loading caused immediate stall, but progressive loading enabled higher power output by preventing aerodynamic separation.

### Performance Results

Testing revealed our blade performed significantly better than predicted: maximum power output consistently occurred around 1300 rpm rather than the designed 900 rpm. At 7 m/s with maximum brake loading, the blade operated at only 1300 rpm—well below the 2000 rpm safety limit—and required progressively higher brake torque to stall as wind speed increased. This indicates we never reached maximum performance within the available test constraints.

**Key Finding:** The blade's aerodynamic capability exceeded both our low-Re design predictions and the tunnel's operational envelope. The 900-to-1300 rpm discrepancy suggests that actual aerodynamic performance exceeded low-Re predictions, likely due to transitional flow effects not captured in steady-state BEM analysis. This demonstrates successful torque optimization while maintaining all safety margins.

## My Contribution

I led the aerodynamic design phase, conducting Reynolds number analysis through Weibull distribution statistical modeling and performing comprehensive airfoil selection studies comparing S1223 against NACA 4412 using XFOIL data and published wind tunnel results. I implemented blade element momentum theory calculations to determine optimal twist and pitch distributions across the blade span, ensuring the design maintained target angle of attack at each radial station.

I developed MATLAB scripts for performance prediction including torque estimation across the wind speed range, and structural validation scripts that computed bending moments from distributed aerodynamic loads and verified bending stresses remained within Accura 25 material limits. My structural analysis predicted the critical failure wind speed of 67.73 m/s using load scaling relationships. Additionally, I coordinated the team's experimental protocol development, establishing the progressive loading strategy that enabled successful torque characterization without premature stall.

## Key Takeaways and Future Work

This project demonstrated successful integration of aerodynamic theory, computational analysis, and experimental validation for low Reynolds number applications. The blade exceeded design performance expectations, validating our torque-first optimization strategy. However, several areas offer opportunities for improvement:

**Design Refinements:** Future iterations should optimize for the 1200-1400 rpm range observed in testing rather than the originally designed 900 rpm, reflecting actual aerodynamic performance capabilities.

**Improved Modeling:** Better prediction of transitional Reynolds number behavior through enhanced CFD mesh quality and boundary conditions would improve design accuracy. Three-dimensional BEM models with dynamic induction effects would provide more accurate performance predictions than the simplified steady-state analysis used.

**Manufacturing Quality:** Eliminating CAD export errors and improving trailing edge geometry definition would ensure better geometric fidelity between design and manufactured blades. The manual .dat file editing required could be avoided with improved CAD modeling techniques.

**Extended Testing:** Expanding testing to higher wind speeds would fully characterize maximum performance and validate the blade's true operating envelope beyond the tunnel's current limitations.

The project successfully achieved its primary objective of torque-optimized operation while satisfying all geometric, material, and safety constraints, demonstrating that specialized low-Reynolds-number airfoils can significantly outperform conventional profiles in small-scale wind turbine applications.
