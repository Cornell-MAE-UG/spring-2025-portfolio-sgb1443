# Fiber Optic Sensor Extrusion End Effector
## Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin Company

**Position:** Blades Manufacturing Engineering Intern  
**Duration:** Summer 2025  
**Status:** Patent Pending

## Project Overview

Designed and developed a custom fiber optic sensor (FOS) extrusion and re-spooling mechanism for automated composite manufacturing. This patent-pending system integrates with a UR-16 robotic arm to enable precise, automated placement of fiber optic sensors in composite layups for structural health monitoring.

## Technical Design

### Mechanical Design

**CAD Development:** Designed custom fiber optic extrusion and re-spooling mechanism using CATIA V5

**System Integration:** Integrated the end effector with:
- UR-16 robotic arm for precise positioning
- Compaction roller for material consolidation
- Heating element for optimal fiber placement

**Application:** Enables automated FOS placement in composite layups for structural health monitoring

### Control Systems Development
