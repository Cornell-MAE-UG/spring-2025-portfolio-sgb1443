# CUAUV
## Cornell Autonomous Underwater Vehicle

**Role:** Mechanical Subteam Lead  
**Team:** Cornell Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (CUAUV)  
**Duration:** October 2022 - Present  
**Competition:** RoboSub International AUV Competition

## Overview

As Mechanical Subteam Lead for CUAUV, I lead the design and fabrication of autonomous underwater vehicles for international competition. My work spans multiple vehicle generations, from senior design projects to competition-ready systems, focusing on structural design, integration, and manufacturing.

## Senior Design Project - Spring 2025

### Compact AUV Design

**Design Philosophy:** Integrated, Minimalistic Architecture

**Key Innovations:**
- **Single Pressure Vessel Integration:** Consolidated all major subsystems into one acrylic pressure vessel
- **Reduced Redundancies:** Eliminated duplicate components and simplified system architecture
- **Minimized External Components:** Internalized previously external systems
- **SEACON Connection Reduction:** Significantly decreased number of underwater connectors

**Frame Design:**
- Developed minimalistic frame optimized for compactness
- Validated all structural components through Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
- Optimized for weight distribution and buoyancy control

**Skills:** SolidWorks, FEA, Systems Integration

## Competition Vehicle Design

### 2024 & 2025 Vehicle Frames

Designed the structural backbone for both competition vehicles:

**Design Responsibilities:**
- **Structural Framework:** Primary load-bearing structure for entire vehicle
- **Component Mounting:** Secure attachment points for all enclosures and systems
- **Pressure Vessel Integration:** Mounting and protection of main pressure vessel
- **Buoyancy Optimization:** Frame design affects vehicle weight distribution and control
- **Thruster Positioning:** Optimal placement for maneuverability and control

**Impact:** The frame design directly influences vehicle hydrodynamics, stability, and functionality during competition missions.

**Skills:** Structural Design, CAD, Hydrodynamics

## Electrical Enclosures

### Transmit Pressure Vessel - Spring 2023

**Purpose:** Houses electrical components for inter-vehicle communication during competition

**Design Work:**
- Designed pressure vessel using SolidWorks
- Conducted structural analysis to ensure underwater integrity
- Optimized internal layout for electronics packaging
- Designed sealing interfaces and cable pass-throughs

**Skills:** Pressure Vessels, SolidWorks, Analysis

## Manufacturing & Fabrication

### Machining Experience

Extensive hands-on manufacturing of vehicle components:
- **CNC Machining:** Programmed and operated Haas CNC mills for precision parts
- **Manual Machining:** Used manual mills and lathes for custom components
- **Material:** Primarily machined aluminum for structural and functional parts
- **Quality Control:** Ensured tight tolerances for underwater sealing and assembly

## Testing & Competition

### Vehicle Preparation & Competition Support

**Summer 2023 & 2024:**
- **Leak Testing:** Conducted comprehensive pressure and leak tests on all enclosures
- **Final Integration:** Assembled complete vehicle systems
- **Mechanism Integration:** Installed and tested all mechanical systems
- **Competition Preparation:** On-site support for RoboSub international competition
- **Field Repairs:** Troubleshooting and repairs during competition

## Technical Skills Developed

- SolidWorks CAD
- FEA Analysis
- CNC Programming
- CNC Machining
- Manual Machining
- Aluminum Fabrication
- Pressure Vessel Design
- O-Ring Sealing
- Systems Integration
- Underwater Robotics
- Team Leadership
