# Tiffany & Co
## Manufacturing & Process Engineering Internship

**Position:** Manufacturing & Process Engineering Intern  
**Duration:** Summer 2024

## Overview

During my internship at Tiffany & Co, I applied engineering principles to luxury jewelry manufacturing, focusing on process optimization, CAD design, and manufacturing efficiency. This unique experience bridged mechanical engineering with high-end jewelry production.

## Key Projects

### Laser Cutting Implementation

**Objective:** Design and implement laser cutting process for Victoria style production

**Approach:**
- Developed complete process workflow for laser cutting integration
- Optimized cutting parameters for precision and efficiency
- Created documentation and training materials for production team

**Impact:** Reduced tongue production cost for Victoria styles by **$60,000/year**

**Skills:** Process Design, Laser Cutting, Cost Optimization

### Victoria Style Clasp Redesign

**Objective:** Improve clasp security for Victoria jewelry styles

**Approach:**
- Analyzed existing clasp mechanisms and failure modes
- Designed improved clasp geometry using Rhino CAD
- Validated design through prototyping and testing

**Outcome:** Increased clasp security and reliability for high-value jewelry pieces

**Skills:** Rhino CAD, Mechanical Design, Product Development

## Responsibilities

### Tooling & Manufacturing
